That art in those contexts\u2014in medieval contexts, and I think to some degree in Indigenous contexts\u2014is a methodology of communication. But communication with what? Well, sometimes it\u0027s human to human, but often it\u0027s not about the human. Often, it\u2019s communication with phenomena, or with visual information that\u0027s coming in. It\u2019s a response. Some people might say it\u2019s prayer, but it\u2019s not really that. And some might say it\u2019s ritual\u2014well, maybe, but extremely personal ritual.

And that is what the art is for, or part of what the art is for.

How we look at it. How we may redefine the language and the procedure of looking so that it\u0027s not extractive, so that I\u0027m not just consuming this image and somehow monetizing it.

Practically this means that I organize my sessions in a modular way, developing multiple exercises for each theme that I want to address. Being responsive is part of creating a space where dialogue can form.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I walk with a group through an exhibition, I ask what we are looking at. They will often try to skip straight to interpreting the meaning of an artwork but I ask them to explain what they see to me first, to start with the obvious. Once we see some aspect of ourselves or experiences reflected in an artwork, that artwork stops being so opaque. It might look complicated but so is the world and we navigate that all the time\u2014just break it down and note your reactions.\u003Cfn\u003EI learned this approach from Nicholas Brown, formerly the curator of Red Bull 381 Projects\u2014a small gallery in downtown Toronto that showed Canadian contemporary art by young artists. The gallery was situated in the lobby of Red Bull Canada\u2019s corporate offices and Nick and I had a lot of contact with office staff, many of whom were interested in art but who had received little arts education since high school. Early on, our programming elicited some negative feedback from staff who often felt skeptical about the skills of the featured artists or were fearful of sounding unintelligent by making the \u201cwrong\u201d observations. So Nick initiated small tours through all of our exhibitions. By offering a welcoming space to ask \u201cobvious\u201d questions and express honest reactions to the shows, Nick was able to transform what could have been antipathy from the surrounding staff into appreciation and support. Mostly he just asked questions like, \u201cwhat\u2019s this?\u201c and \u201cwhere are we?\u201d, which worked because that\u2019s often what artists are trying to figure out, too.\u003C\/fn\u003E To be in relation to something in this way means that listening is important, listening to ourselves, that is, honestly, and to what we see in front of us in the gallery.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis conceptual framework maps readily onto the aural: a place of creation that we might understand through our relationship to music but which is still mystifying if explored through field recordings or ambient sound installations. R. Murray Schaefer, a Canadian theorist and composer developed the study of \u201cAcoustic Ecology\u201d in the 1960s while a professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. Along with Hildegard Westerkamp, Barry Truax, Bruce Davies, Peter Huse, and others, Schaffer collected audio field recordings that documented the changing sonic environments that they encountered. These activities supported their \u201cWorld Soundscape Project\u201d and have helped advance understandings of both the psychological and physiological effects of noise pollution while emphasizing the creative possibilities latent within these sounds.\u003Cfn\u003EFor more on the World Soundscape Project see https:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/sonic-studio-webdav\/WSP\/index.html.\u003C\/fn\u003E Key to all of these efforts was an emphasis on listening, as not only a communicative act but also one that inherently grounds us in our spatial context\u2014whether we acknowledge it or not.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESound situates us at a unique position in space, we are always at the centre of our sonic perception. Through an act of unconscious imagination, we use sound to map and internalize the environment, even the parts of it that are invisible. Educators can exploit this subtle link to engage the imagination by asking learners to visualize audio environments. Before guiding students through the Biennial exhibition, I talked about how hearing passively grounds our experience in a fluid mental model as I played a series of field recordings over a small speaker system. While listening, I\u2019d ask students to draw or write where they imagined themselves to be.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Caudio controls=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Csource src=\u0022\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-09\/1_Field%20Recording_Garden.mp3\u0022 type=\u0022audio\/mpeg\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/audio\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022caption\u0022\u003EMark Dudiak, \u003Cem\u003EField Recording: Garden\u003C\/em\u003E (2019).

But I\u2019ve found that it can be hard to complete something that youth participants value in the hour or so that I set aside for creation in my workshops\u2014paint takes time to dry, complex projects require tools or a bunch of preparatory steps. It\u2019s important that groups feel they have meaningfully interacted with the exhibited works that can include a lot of media content. With all this in mind, I developed a workshop project that was simple but novel, one that introduced performance and experimental audio arts as accessible and rewarding.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter completing our time with the artworks on display, I would ask the group to join me outside in the parking lot. Using chalk, the learners were encouraged to write a large word onto the land, such as one of the terms generated during the listening session.

Courtesy of the Toronto Biennial of Art.\u003C\/div\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, art has never been about the discreteness of objects so much as the creative construction of experience as it exists, always in process. \u201cOrdinary\u201d objects are not even objects: they are a pulsation in the eventfulness of experience itself. To identify an object as distinct from others is to analytically isolate it from the emotions, sensoria, and psycho-kinesthetic circuits that are concurrent with our perceptions of that object. When I pass by Dana Claxton\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/torontobiennial.org\/work\/dana-claxton-at-259-lake-shore\/\u0022\u003Efireboxes\u003C\/a\u003E, they fuse with the flow of my vitality, retuning my nervous system and shifting the parameters of my perception\u2014even if imperceptibly, performing this transformation so subtly I don\u2019t cognize it. Objectification is a tactic by our reasoning minds to abstract away from embodiment\u2014certainly useful sometimes, but also overvalued and habitual in how we look at and think about art. And though historical, contextual frameworks are absolutely vital, they can overshadow the simple and direct firsthand experience of artworks, the first shock of their entrance into your body-and-mind; how do we give room for the artwork\u2019s energy to be felt in and for itself?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of my work as a Storyteller for the Biennial has been to refocus on experience and experiment with alternative avenues of encounter with art. At one point I gently invited two visitors to sing a song to Fernando Palma Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/torontobiennial.org\/work\/fernando-palma-rodriguez-at-259-lake-shore\/\u0022\u003Ebutterflies\u003C\/a\u003E and, unbeknownst to me, they were trained in an Arabic classical tradition; the synthesis of those mechanical wings and the melancholy of the music created a miniature, sublime bubble of intimacy at the 259 Lake Shore exhibition venue.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe uncommon community creates a transhuman ecological community that links us to the alien yet animated vital essences of artworks themselves.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EMEDITATION: ATTACHMENT\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A monitor on a plain white wall displays the text \u0026amp;quot;Thoughts?

Plastered with logos and donation tiers, these kinds of murals are normally passed over as merely peripheral information, not art proper. But precisely because we habitually graze over the surface of it (and I certainly used to ignore it in my haste to see the art itself), expecting it to bore us, does it hold the most power to hide away the ideologies behind art\u2019s material conditions.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sponsors\u2019 wall stands as a ledger of abstractions.

Gendai has transformed many times over the last two decades, exploring various organizational models and methodologies, where the gallery breathes and responds like a living organism; the function and purpose of the gallery is shaped by the needs of the moment, responding to changing situations. Operating as a collective rather than a hierarchical organization, Gendai was built upon a shared ethos, interests, and conversations, where strong friendships have blossomed. Since 2011, they have been mobile. Their history of experimentation with collective models and practices of reconfigurability, collaboration, and adaptability are reflected in recent projects involving film, modular furniture, publications, treehouse dinner parties, newspapers, screenings, haikus, neighbourhood survey actions, a lemonade stand, musical jingles, and collective readings.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EOur curatorial intentions and visions in creating the Programs Hub at the Biennial aligned strongly with Gendai\u2019s history of generating playful, alternative methodologies for co-existence in seeking new ways of being together. \u003Cem\u003EGendai Mobile Unit \u003C\/em\u003Eis a functional artwork by Alexandre David, commissioned by Gendai and artist Yam Lau in 2011 when the gallery went mobile.

Outspoken and proudly Black with a defiant stance on US Civil Rights, Ali was overwhelmingly supported across Africa in his challenge of Foreman, who was more reserved and considered by many a symbol of the white establishment. Defeating Foreman and reclaiming the world champion title in this match, Ali became a definite hero across Africa for his strength, defiance, and global fame.

At the time, Foreman was the world heavyweight champion, and Ali the challenger and former champion. \u201cAli bome ye\u201d (Kill him, Ali) was not only the chant that reverberated throughout the area in support of Ali during the match, but also one that epitomized Ali\u2019s connection with Africa. Outspoken and proudly Black with a defiant stance on US Civil Rights, Ali was overwhelmingly supported across Africa in his challenge of Foreman, who was more reserved and considered by many a symbol of the white establishment. Defeating Foreman and reclaiming the world champion title in this match, Ali became a definite hero across Africa for his strength, defiance, and global fame.

Cheikh Anta Diop (1923\u201386) was a Senegalese historian, anthropologist, physicist, and political leader who is widely considered to have first introduced Afrocentrism in his 1951 PhD dissertation examining ancient Egyptian history and its influence on European culture. In it, he argued that African civilizations were the inspiration and origin of European accomplishments, which earned him the enmity of Eurocentric historians. His dissertation was rejected by the University of Paris (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9), but Pr\u00e9sence Africaine published it as part of Diop\u2019s famous book, \u003Cem\u003ENations n\u00e8gres et culture: de l\u0027antiquit\u00e9 n\u00e8gre-\u00e9gyptienne aux probl\u00e8mes culturels de l\u0027Afrique noire d\u0027aujourd\u0027hui\u003C\/em\u003E in 1954.
