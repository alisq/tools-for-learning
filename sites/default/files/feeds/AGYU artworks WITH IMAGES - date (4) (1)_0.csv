A trio of ghostly figures, derived from a historic photograph of three unidentified Indigenous people, wear western dress and stand at a graveside.As with much of Beam's print work, the image is heavily layered and liberally uses phototransfers. These three figures appear in numerous other prints, witnesses to the colonialist history of Canada. Four colour blocks appear on the lower edge of the print, with pictographs and the words ""1984 Reason will win."" Perhaps this references the 450 anniversary of Cartier's arrival in North America, and the hope that the colonial legacy that arrival instigated would soon fade. Alas, the phrase is crossed out, suggesting a less hopeful interpretation.Not a good description","A trio of ghostly figures, derived from a historic photograph of three unidentified Indigenous people, wear western dress and stand at a graveside.

Referencing in cloth the landscape tradition championed by Canadian painters such as the Group of Seven, the individual views also appear as photographic ""snapshots"" of the Canadian landscape.  Wieland experimented with non-traditional materials and forms throughout her career and began working with fabric in 1964-65.  Creating assemblages, collages and soft sculptures out of plastic shapes and found objects, she challenged the dominance of painting and traditional fine art materials through the use of materials and techniques associated with the domestic environment.  A passionate and pioneering feminist, Wieland sought out opportunities to work collaboratively with other women in the production of art objects that included quilts and knitted art works.In this quilt, Wieland has adapted the medium of painting and the genre of landscape to her own unique vision.  The tradition of quilt making has also been transformed, for Wieland’s quilts are very different from the customary patchwork quilt so familiar in North America.  Such quilts are often highly structured with designs that follow a rigid template requiring meticulous hand stitching by anonymous creators.  Preferring the free form and the casual to the confining strictures of tradition, Wieland has remade the medium to one distinctly her own. At the same time, Wieland acknowledged and credited the contributions of other participants in the creative process.   This quilt was created for True Patriot Love/Veritable Amour Patriotique (1971), the first solo exhibition granted to a living female artist in the history of the National Gallery of Canada. In 1972, the Art Gallery of York University purchased the work from the artist for the permanent collection.Text : by Debra Antoncic and Joyce Zemans",256.50 x 802.60 cm,,,,"150,000.00",,,,,,,Quilted assemblage on cloth,Permanent Display,textile,72.3,"Purchased from Isaacs Gallery, Toronto$ 8, 000",,,109 Views of Canada,,Joyce Wieland,,,,,,,,,

Discolouration on surface, cracks on body of sculpture,  and paint loss. Needs to be cleaned.November 2002Following vandalism to the sculpture (parts of the sculpture were painted green in March 2001) Srebenka B. Zeskoski, Conservator, In Restauro Conservart, Inc. undertook the following restorative measures.Treatment ReportAll the paint was stripped off to the original fiberglass surface, sanded where necessary. Junctions of the tubes and all cracks and fissures were treated with epoxy resin (used for fiberglass boats)...All the bolts were treated with commercial rust remover, rust scraped and/or chipped away. Where the washers were eaten away a mastic compound was used to fill in any holes and prevent  ingress of water. The bolts before painted in the original colours were primed with metal primer.The segments of the sculpture were repainted according to the original scheme. Artist Hugh Leroy actually  provided a maquette against removed paint chips were matched. Those in turn were sent to a paint specialist who computer matched them to  the provided paint batches. The paint used is a specialized coat for fiberglass and particularly formulated to withstand moisture. It is composed of syrene (or vinyl toluene) and acrylic monomers resin solution 1866. It has to be mixed with hardener/catalyst “Peroxide 50% Mek” and “air dry” gel.The overhanging structure(s) of the Ross building complex are endangering the sculpture and should be looked after as soon as possible. The underside  stucco/intonaco is falling off in rather large chunks which are falling onto the sculpture as  well and harming the surface. Scratches, dents etc. break the homogeneity of the coat and enable the entrance of water which when it freezes will “lift” the coat again and cause premature peeling. Srebenka also spoke with Hugh Leroy who informed her that originally the pool had to be painted black, as well as the immersed part of the sculpture thus achieving the total reflection which would create an illusion of  “closed” ellipses. Maybe painting the “pool” properly can be considered in the near future.",,P10310,Outdoor Sculpture Collection,Satisfactory,,,,Outdoor sculpture collection: Scott Library Watercourse,,1972,,,264.00 x 875.00 x 639.00 cm,,,,"30,000.00",,,,,,,Painted fibreglass,permanent display,sculpture; outdoor collection,72.18,"Purchased from Waddington Galleries, Montreal$ 4,200",,,"""Rainbow"" Piece",,Hugh Leroy,,,,,,,,,

They are among his most accomplished works on paper, ranging from the highly finished to the more ephemeral ‘sketch.’  Born in 1947, Therrien is a sculptor who was raised in Chicago and who has been living in Los Angeles since 1971.  While clearly grounded in a Minimalist aesthetic and indebted equally to Brancusi’s essentialism, Therrien’s work also feeds off and responds to various tendencies in post 1960’s west coast American art.  It mediates between the ascetic spirituality of west coast abstraction (ie: Robert Irwin) on the one hand, and the pop/conceptualism of Ed Ruscha and his epigones, Charles Ray and Mike Kelly on the other.  Yet the domestic, modest, understated qualities of Therrien’s art - its fusion of interiority and representationality, its elliptical metaphoricity, its equally gentle and mordant humor - belong to Therrien alone.  His art melds qualities of objectivity with romantic introspection.  Various sculptors in Canada are producing work that shares the metaphoricity and the ‘object poem’ qualities of Therrien’s art.",1 7/8 x 1 1/4 in.,P10742,,,"2,750.00",,,,,,,Ink and shellac on paper,storage,work on paper,97.1,"donation from artist’s studio to Mr. Odette, 1995",Credit Line:  Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Odette,,Untitled (Coffin),,Robert Therrien,,,,,Louis L.

The first part, a dwelling or ‘house’ is an organic construction, fabricated without nails, glue or paint.  Because the walls have side fenestrations and the roof is open to the sky, its space is subject to the changing light conditions during the course of the day.  This structure modulates sound.  Nordman was originally a musician and all her scuptures are resonant bodies, where sound and sculpture are always joined.  It is a work which can exist either assembled or dis-assembled.  Nordman thus declares an equivalence between the whole and its parts.  The second part is a 9’ x 9’ quilt with a minimal pattern in blue, red, green, black and white which relates to the elements of the outdoor sculpture.  This interior construction is illuminated solely by kerosene lamps, evocative of pre-industrial age dwellings.

Since his earliest projects in the late 1970’s, Graham has set up a nature/culture polarity that recognizes the unique power of modern culture.  Graham calls our attention to the machines which intervene in the experience of nature.  His projects recognize our current alientation from nature, yet also aspire to an eventual utopian state of consciousness in which technological developments and an ecological sensitivity can converge.

He works largely with Brazilian soapstone and uses a vast array of hand tools rather than power tools.  Many of his sculptures are hugely complex compositions that sometimes include figures swirling together or with spirits and animals.  Another departure from the tradition is the sometimes monumental scale of his work.  He finishes the stone with sandpaper and Minwax tung oil.  The artist cooks some peices in an oven at 800-1200 degrees to give the stone a hardness like steel.  Extensive, fine inlay work, often in red pipestone, is also a hallmark of Anghik’s work.

This suite of forty-three images represents the initial phase of the project, in which the artists have established a collage language based on a shared art iconography.  The images were drawn from the 1950s issues of Life Magazine as well as other publications from the same period, among them a 1940s German magazine, Volk und Welt, which provided three of the floral images.  Research later revealed the photographer of these images to be Karl Blossfeldt, who was not credited in the issue.  The project began with the exchange os 11 x 14 inch collage boards, with each artist adding or deleting elements successively.  Eventually, the hard collages were digitized, and the exchange continued on computer.  The computer files were output to 4 x 5 inch color transparencies and printed on Ektachrome paper.",40.6 x 50.8 cm,P10756,5/30,,750,,,,,,"signed by both artists, dated, titled, chopped with the Afterlife logo",Rreversal colour print on Kodak Ektachrome Radiance paper,Storage,print,98.1.27,,Credit Line:  Gift of Mrs. Vivian Campbell,,Natural Anthuriums 4 (Afterlife Series),,John Massey and Becky Singleton,,,,,Mrs. Vivian Campbell,,,,
