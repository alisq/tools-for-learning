<h4>The Symbolic Language of Wampum Diplomacy </h4>
<p>
<strong>September 28, 11:30am–1:30pm, online</strong><br />
Participants: Alan Ojig Corbiere, Rick Hill, Ange Loft<br />
Partners: York University</p>

<p>At the 1764 Treaty of Niagara, The British extended their nearly century-old Covenant Chain alliance with the Haudenosaunee, to the 24 Western Nations of the Great Lakes area. In this talk, Dr. Alan Ojig Corbiere and Rick Hill will discuss the Covenant Chain, the visual and metaphoric language of wampum diplomacy and explore the symbolism represented in the 1764 and 24 Nations belts delivered at Niagara to secure this crucial alliance. The symbolism inscribed in these belts drew from the Dish with One Spoon Wampum, and would have been used deliberately as a means of securing relations with Indigenous nations. Ange Loft will discuss the ways this visual language is deployed in her current <em>A Treaty Guide for Torontonians</em> and <em>Dish Dances</em>, both of which will be featured in the 2022 Toronto Biennial of Art. </p>

<h4>Conversation with Karen Pheasant-Neganigwane and Tanya Lukin Linklater</h4>

Partners: Culture Days</p>

<p>During this conversation, Karen Pheasant-Neganigwane and Tanya Lukin Linklater share insights into their practices as artists, educators, and writers working within Indigenous performance methodologies. Reflecting on their ongoing relationships with one another, place, language, and those who have shaped their work over time, Pheasant-Neganigwane and Lukin Linklater carefully consider their personal processes of situating embodied practices in community and in the arts. They will speak to the Indigenous performance histories that ground their contemporary approaches, as well as the role of intergenerational exchange as a mode of learning. The conversation, with moderator Clare Butcher, takes place ahead of Lukin Linklater’s contribution to the 2022 edition of the Toronto Biennial of Art and the Culture Days Creatives in Residence Program.</p>

Facilitated by: Ange Loft and Syrus Marcus Ware<br />
Partners: grunt gallery, Black Lives Matter – Toronto (Wildseed Black Arts Fellowship)</p>

<p>In the Fall of 2020, the Biennial hosted a research-based, experimental, virtual residency, <em>Rabbit Hole: Pod Theory</em>, wherein TBA curators, commissioned participants, and facilitators came together as an interwoven network of pods. Inspired by Mia Mingus and the Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective’s (BATJC) pod-mapping exercise, each TBA curator invited an artist into their temporary pod, working together over a two-week period to share methodologies and collaborative approaches within an ethos of care between all participants. Led and facilitated by Ange Loft and Syrus Marcus Ware, this residency explored the mythologies, caveats, protocols, and diverse practices of collectivity and connectivity across multiple time zones and geographies. The <em>Rabbit Hole: Pod Theory</em> residency participants met each day in a virtual rabbit hole together, forming connections through sharing research, methodologies, and potential resources over a series of workshops, presentations, discussions, and debate—some intimate and others public-facing. Across digital, geographical, temporal distances, the residency held space for re-imagining collectivity in this moment in time.</p>

<p><em>Rabbit Hole: Pod Theory</em> was made possible with the generous support of Toronto Arts Council</p>

Featuring music written for the horns of tugboats, trawlers, ferries, leisure vessels, and ocean-going freighters, each Harbour Symphony since 1983 has begun with a radio countdown transmitted to the bridge of the ships by the coastguard where players stand at the helms of their respective vessels. At the signal, a giant, floating horn section reverberates off the surrounding landscape and through the streets. Musicians from all over the world have been invited to create a Harbour Symphony, and the concept has so far been shared with the cities of Amsterdam, Vancouver, Montreal, San Francisco, and now Toronto. This Harbour Symphony includes newly commissioned compositions for the event.</p>

During the session, Elder Duke Redbird engages visitors in questions around “Our Environment,” focusing on Indigenous perspectives about stemming destruction based on age-old practices together with reverence and respect for Mother Earth. Over the summer and fall, visitors have an opportunity to spend time, learn from, and celebrate the Indigenous peoples who historically thrived, sustained, and populated the extensive shoreline of Lake Ontario.</p>



<h4>The Collaborative Body</h4>

<p><strong>October 6, 3:30–5pm at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E</strong><br />
    Participants: Kim Tomczak and Lisa Steele<br />
    Stream: Currents<br />
    “Since 1983, we have worked in relation to each other: we collaborate as artists, as administrators, as organizers, and as teachers; and we work in relation to others—in artist-run centres, festivals, publications, and public institutions—in the spirit of collectivity where we share experience and knowledge and accept the same from others while ideas, statements, and direct acts are developed together and put into action where they evolve over time—never static. Each of the three parts of <em>…before I wake</em>, the work on display at the Biennial, is a contemplation on collaboration itself. We see the bodies of the artists in <em>We’re getting younger all the time</em> using the digital devices to mimic the quest for eternal youth; in <em>Practicing Death</em>, the artists are displayed in a type of suspended sleep; and finally, <em>Entranced</em> finds the artists under hypnosis, each walking through a door where the collaboration will cease to be.” —Kim Tomczak and Lisa Steele</p>

<p>In the walkabout, artists Kim Tomczak and Lisa Steele engage in questions of representation of collaboration and “the collective” and suggest how collaboration itself contradicts or at least undermines the idea of the individual artist-as-creative-genius. They also discuss the ways that artists have confronted death in their work, from Brueghel to Caravaggio to Warhol to Rebecca Belmore.</p>

    Contributor: John Wilson<br />
    Stream: Storytelling<br />
    John Wilson of the Lost Rivers initiative guides a walk-through Marie Curtis Park to the mouth of Etobicoke Creek on the border between Toronto (Etobicoke) and Mississauga. This river mouth was one of two points along Etobicoke Creek that used to survey the western line of the Toronto Purchase, the treaty between Indigenous Mississaugas of the Credit and the British Crown that permitted European settlement. This line still forms much of the boundary between York and Peel Regions.

<p>Stream: Co-Relations</p>

<p><em>Sonifying the Plants </em>with Miya Masaoka is a part of <em>TELLINGS</em>—a post-human vocal concert series—and a performative lecture and demonstration of Masaoka’s pioneering interactive work using the biological response of plants. The sound artist is an Associate Professor at Columbia University where she is Director of the Sound Art Program, and her works with plants have been exhibited at New Interfaces for Musical Expressions, Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique, the Gutenberg Sound Art Academy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Lincoln Center Out of Doors (Instrument Making) among others.      </p>



<h4>TELLINGS: A Post-Human Vocal Concert</h4>

<p><strong>November 16, 3–7pm at OCAD University, 205 Richmond St W</strong><br />
Participants: Erin Gee, Jeneen Frei Njootli, Miya Masaoka, Stephanie Loveless, and Tsēmā Igharas<br />

Co-curators: Maiko Tanaka and Myung-Sun Kim<br />

<p>Co-presented with Canadian Music Centre, OCAD University Graduate Studies, and Trinity Square Video</p>

<p>Stream: Co-Relations</p>

<p><em>TELLINGS: A Post-Human Vocal Concert</em> seeks to challenge traditional conceptions of voice. Artists working experimentally with sound—live electronics, deep listening, and sound art—perform compositions that explore new modes of vocal production. The experimental vocal compositions in solo and ensemble formats question the way we imagine the body of a voice and the "receiver," as well as the divisions made between nature and technology. Each composition performed in <em>TELLINGS</em> presents increasingly inter-species, inter-organ, feminist, and collaborative notions through the languages of plants, animals, and even human organs not normally associated with having authorship or intention.</p>



<h4>Delineating a Nation-state: A Conversation</h4>

<p><strong>November 16, 2–4pm at the Small Arms Inspection Building</strong><br />
Participants: Karyn Recollet, Irena Latek, and Roberto Damiani, with Adrian Blackwell and David Fortin <br />

Stream: Currents<br />

<p><em>Delineating a Nation-state</em> is a preview of the forthcoming issue 12 of <em>Scapegoat: Architecture / Landscape / Political Economy</em>, featuring Roberto Damiani, Irena Latek, and Karyn Recollet, and moderated by co-editors David Fortin and Adrian Blackwell. This conversation examines the relationship between urban morphology and processes of settler colonialism, through the delineation of property in land.</p>

<p>The building of a nation-state involves the drawing of lines on pieces of paper and the transcription of those lines onto a territory. All architects’ drawings are constrained and structured by these primary processes of delineation. This conversation brings together two foundational discourses about national space—an architectural conversation about the relationship between property division and architectural form and an ongoing debate about the land-appropriations of settler colonialism.</p>



<h4>Ground, breath, moisture, cusp with Zahra Komeylian</h4>

<p><strong>November 17, 11:15am–1:30pm at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E</strong><br />
Contributor: Zahra Komeylian<br />

Stream: Tools for Learning<br />

<p>This workshop with Zahra Komeylian explores a place of meeting between the clay, body, and breath. Through the medium of clay, participants are invited into an embodied reflection on being in relation with the collective and the ground, cultivating spaces for support and anchoring during times of change and shift. How can we be anchored while in flux? This session involves breathwork, contemplative sculpting, a walk along the shoreline, and a group-building activity. No prior experience working with clay is necessary—bring a beginner’s mind.</p>



<h4>What's Up with Gendai?</h4>

<p><strong>November 17, 2:30–4:30pm at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E</strong><br />
Participants: Gendai Gallery (Chris Lee, Emily Fitzpatrick, Maiko Tanaka, Marilyn Jung, Su-Ying Lee, and Yan Wu)<br />

Stream: Co-Relations<br />

<p>Founded in 2000, Gendai is a Toronto-based art organization that supports contemporary practices—primarily by East Asian artists and artists of colour. Since 2011 they have been mobile. Their history of experimentation with collective models and practice of reconfigurability, collaboration, and adaptability is reflected in recent projects involving film, modular furniture, publications, treehouse dinner parties, newspapers, screenings, haikus, neighbourhood survey actions, a lemonade stand, musical jingles, and collective readings.</p>

<p>They share the gallery’s organizational history of experimenting with models of collectivity and workshop proposals (open call to the public) for a takeover. On their way out, the members draw on their history of generating alternative methodologies for existence in seeking new ways of succession planning for the gallery. This opportunity for the next generation to adopt an existing organization with a critical legacy is grounded in the experimental integrity of Gendai’s pedagogical framework that fosters collaboration and adaptation to current environments.</p>



<h4>The View from Here: Reading a Moving Shoreline</h4>

<p><strong>November 18, 4–6pm at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E</strong><br />
Participants: Adrian Blackwell and Fadi Masoud <br />

As part of the series around Luis Jacob's two-part installation <em>The View from Here</em> and within Blackwell’s structure <em>Isonomia in Toronto? (harbour)</em>, Masoud and Blackwell discuss Toronto’s waterfront, drawing attention to the vulnerabilities of urban districts built upon reclaimed land, and the strategies available to mitigate the effects of climate change. Participants join in a mapping exercise, tracing the human and non-human actors transforming the shoreline, and through this activity, encourage a literacy of the interaction between the natural and operational forces creating urban space.</p>



<h4>The View from Here: With Bonnie Devine and Luis Jacob</h4>

<p><strong>November 25, 2–4pm at Union Station, Oak Room</strong><br />
Participants: Bonnie Devine and Luis Jacob<br />

<p>In response to various objects in Luis Jacob’s installation <em>The View from Here</em>, and as part of the surrounding series, Bonnie Devine introduces a surveyor’s transit from her project <em>Circles and Lines: Michi Saagiig</em>, 2018. View-finding instruments have been used since antiquity to mark out, allot, and regulate land, including the land of the Mississauga Nation that was transferred to the British in the Toronto Purchase of 1787 and the Toronto Indenture of 1805. Bringing Jacob’s sculpture <em>The Riddle</em><em> </em>(2018) into conversation with the transit, Devine engages visitors in a discussion around cartography, ownership, and the weaponization of the Colonial gaze.</p>

Stream: Currents<br />

<p>This conversation opens up the processes and practice behind Curtis Talwst Santiago’s Biennial contributions: his ongoing <em>Infinity Series</em>, which inspired a host of responses from school students during the Biennial’s facilitated workshops; and the architectural fantasy or “capriccio” installed at 55 Unwin, <em>J’ouvert Temple </em>(2019). With writer Yaniya Lee, the artist considers residual histories and shifting scales of intimacy.</p>



<h4>Workshop with Anu Radha Verma</h4>

<p><strong>November 30, 10:30am–1:30pm at the Small Arms Inspection Building</strong><br />
Contributor: Anu Radha Verma<br />

Stream: Tools for Learning<br />

<p>As part of the Biennial’s series of artist- and educator-facilitated workshops, this session with organizer Anu Radha Verma takes up the concept of “being in relation” through activities that look at time, place, and possibilities. “Time” refers to history, the archival (whether documented or not); “place” refers to the sites we inhabit; and “possibilities” connects to what the future might hold, what we might make of the future. Workshop participants can expect some movement (optional and can be adapted to meet access needs); discussions and reflection; collage and writing prompts; and more. The workshop addresses four key questions: Who are we? Where have we been? Where are we? Where are we going? Through conversations and activities, participants learn about themselves, each other, the Small Arms Inspection Building, and ideas that some of the artists exhibiting their work in the Biennial are putting forward. The workshop is designed to be participatory, with options for individual, pair, small group, and large group interactions.</p>



<h4>Art in Access</h4>

<p><strong>November 30, 1–4pm at the Humber Art Commons</strong><br />
Contributor: Art in Access<br />

Co-presented with Among Friends Community Mental Health Program, Humber College, Humber Galleries, and Workman Arts<br />

<p>Stream: Co-Relations</p>

<p>From 1890 to 1979, the Humber College Lakeshore Campus was a psychiatric hospital. Addressing the complex legacy of their school, Humber College students engage with issues of access through creative workshops and collaborations with community members. Artists from Among Friends Community Mental Health Program and Workman Arts offer creative sessions for students on wellness, mental health, disability, housing, and food security. Creating reactionary artworks, Humber students and their community collaborators present artefacts, installations, and drop-in workshops to enliven critical debates on social and systemic barriers while providing a space where art and access can collide. This community-engaged project explores the deep relationship building at the critical meeting points of art, education, community, and access-oriented programs, particularly around mental health and questions of livability.</p>



<h4>A Walk Across Space and Time</h4>

<p><strong>November 30, 1:30–4pm at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E</strong><br />
Participants: James Roche, Jane Wolff, Anishinaabe Grandmother Kim Wheatley, Sandy Smith, and Susan Schwartzenberg <br />

Stream: Storytelling<br />

<p>The goal of <em>A Walk Across Space and Time </em>is to observe—and share observations—about plural understandings of the shoreline, Toronto, and the landscape embodied in the area around 259 Lake Shore Blvd E. The past remains present in the material landscape, but its absence from most people’s everyday consciousness is striking. Through walking and talking indoors and outdoors together with Anishinaabe Grandmother Kim Wheatley, James Roche, Susan Schwartzenberg, Sandy Smith, and Jane Wolff, we can observe and document what comes to the surface. As part of the walk, a temporary installation transforms part of the Programs Hub at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E into a field station where visitors can trace their own relationships to the shoreline.</p>



<h3>2013 — DECEMBER</h3>

<h4>Haruko Okano: Six Chairs in a Circle</h4>

    Participants: Haruko Okano, with Ayumi Goto, Cheryl Trudeau, Elwood Jimmy, and Peter Morin<br />
    Stream: Co-Relations</p>

<p>In <em>Six Chairs in a Circle, </em>artist Haruko Okano invites<em> </em>Ayumi Goto, Cheryl Trudeau, Elwood Jimmy, and Peter Morin to explore ideas of collectivity based on desire, love, relation-building, empathy, collaboration, and generosity. Learning from human and non-human living networks and systems, each contributor shares knowledge, experience, and methods of gathering through differences and conflicted narratives deriving from the complexities of sharing an intercultural landscape. By exploring methods of non-hierarchical collectivity, this conversation aims to deepen our understandings of various value systems and shift the way in which we come together in intimate spaces—at home, the workplace, and other social settings. The circle then opens up for participants to join the conversation and evoke a sense of interconnectedness and belonging.</p>



<h3>ONGOING</h3>

<h4>Storytelling Sessions</h4>

<p><strong></strong>Fridays (5–7pm) and Saturdays/Sundays (12–2pm) from September 21 through December 1 at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E; Saturdays and Thursdays/Sundays (12–2pm) from September 22 through December 1 at the Small Arms Inspection Building</strong><br />

An intergenerational and multilingual group of storytellers share personal insights and experiences of the city as they guide visitors through the Exhibition’s installations, research, and political perspectives. Taking us along hidden river routes, through archives, and into speculative futures, storytellers bring submerged narratives related to Toronto’s shifting shoreline to the surface.</p>



<h4>Tools for Learning Toolbox</h4>

    for Learning</p>

<p>Generated with Biennial participants and collaborators, the toolbox comprises group exercises, performative scores, proposals for collaborative thinking and making, artist interviews, and audio tours. Tools can be instruments to make and repair, but also strategies to undo and refuse. Whether in the Biennial, the classroom, or at home, our multimedia toolbox can be put to use by educators, students, and other community members in connecting their own experiences and curricula with process-based, playful approaches to contemporary artistic practices. Practically and conceptually, the toolbox offers materials and methods for reimagining relations with land, water, and each other. Designed by Chris Lee and Ali Shamas Qadeer, it can be downloaded for free <a href="https://torontobiennial.org/tools-for-learning/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Guest curator: Charles Stankievech</p>

<p>In partnership with COMME des GARÇONS, MVS Proseminars at the University of Toronto—John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, and Ontario Place Corporation</p>

<p>During the Biennial, the Cinesphere becomes a world within a world, merging film and sound art with scent and changing atmospheric conditions. From cosmological origin stories to a future in which civilization is extinct, <em>The Drowned World</em> contrasts deep time with the decline of global ecologies. The project’s title refers to J.G. Ballard’s 1962 archaeopsychic cli-fi novel in which the ice caps have melted and submerged the world, forcing the migration of a dwindling and devolving human species into the Canadian Arctic.</p>

<p>Prehistoric sounds; the sonification of a dying star; the submarine beats of Detroit’s bubble metropolis; the sacrifice of a muskrat; the love of an octopus—within this brave new world, the artificial boundaries of modernity’s civilizations have evaporated, and life in all its forms continues to shift.</p>



<p><strong>Antarctica</strong></p>

<p>Every Friday (5–5:30pm and 6:15–6:45pm) and Sunday (2–2:30pm and 3:15–3:45pm) from September 22 through December 1 at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E; no 6:15pm performance on October 11, and no 5pm performances from October 18 through November 29.</p>

<p><strong>November 2, 2–4pm at the Small Arms Inspection Building</strong><br />
Participants: Adam Khalil, Christopher Bracken, and Jackson Polys<br />

Stream: Currents<br />

<p>“Why Savage Philosophy Now?” is a talk by Christopher Bracken in discussion with two members of New Red Order, Adam Khalil and Jackson Polys. More than a decade ago, in Bracken's book, <em>Magical Criticism</em>, he echoed Heidegger in posing the scandalous question, “What are savages for?” His answer at the time was: “Savage philosophers are the outgrowths of discourse, and they dare us to think more by daring to enrich signs with a principle of change.” In this talk, inspired by the appropriation of Bracken's work by the NRO, he revisits the theory of savage philosophy and asks: what are the stakes of affirming “the being of non-being”?</p>

<h4>Performances by RISE Edutainment</h4>

The first includes excerpts from <em>Qué haré con mi lugar en el cielo</em>, a new collection of poems by Wingston González, along with Noel's translation of his work. These poems were inspired by the sculptures of Naufus Ramírez Figueroa, which reflect on the figure of the <em>silleros</em> (porters used to carry people or their belongings) in colonial Latin America. Noel then shares work from his own practice, rooted in an ongoing dialogue with González.</p>

<h4>Performance by Lawrence Abu Hamdan</h4>

<p><strong>November 15, 7–9pm at 259 Lake Shore Blvd E</strong><br />
Contributor: Lawrence Abu Hamdan<br />

In partnership with the British Council<br />

<p>Stream: Currents</p>

<p>In Lawrence Abu Hamdan's performance <em>Contra Diction</em>, he seeks to explore the ways in which our right to silence can be preserved in today’s All-Hearing and All-Speaking society. In his reappraisal of silence and its politics, Abu Hamdan looks into the linguistics of <em>Taqiyya</em>, an old piece of Islamic jurisprudence practised only by esoteric minorities that allows a believing individual to deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal acts while they are at risk of persecution or in a condition of statelessness. By looking into stories of alleged mass conversions of the Druze minority in northern Syria, Abu Hamdan indicates how such minor speech acts can help us re-appraise the precision of speaking, the multiple ways of remaining silent, and the inherently unfaithful nature of one’s voice.</p>

<p><em>My sister by the river </em>is a séance to mourn and move memories of lost feminist kin into the future. Performed by an ad hoc coven of artists, this séance engages rituals of radical remembrance and hospitality as a method of solidarity building among the living and the dead.<em> My sister by the river </em>is conceived and created by Annie Wong with performers Frizz Kid, Nedda Baba, and Yara El Safi, and co-produced by Marilyn Fernandes and Pamila Matharu.</p>

<p>The November 23 event at the Small Arms Inspection Building is a conversation with Sister Co-Resister and collaborators speaking to their shared letters to Spirits, the intentions behind each member’s ritual practice, and other processes involved in the making of the collective séance.</p>

<p><em>Reflections and Repercussions </em>explores the interplay among luminosity, acoustic, and architectural relationships within the space. Performing with various types of lightning equipment such as theatre lights, flashlights, bare light bulbs, mirrors, and other objects, Onda arranges and rearranges the tools composing the visual and aural as a total environment. The complex relationship between the concrete and the ephemeral is explored.</p>

<p>Relating to <em>Reflections and Repercussions</em> is ...<em>Crow meets Salmon</em>, this performance by Ayumi Goto and Peter Morin moves together and apart with respect to all that has accumulated in these sites, locations, and histories. Crow-salmon-human relations provide a prism through which to examine the interconnections between sky, water, land, and the mutability of forms toward making a joyous sound for creating joyful kinships.</p>
